Paragon provides the opportunity to have hands-on experience working with a government partner on a tech policy initiative—a reality that I did not think was possible. To have the incredible privilege to conduct in-depth research on a real-world tech policy challenge, it reaffirms my passions about public service, making a difference in their community, and learning how to build leadership.",

The work environment is filled with passionate, driven individuals, and the amount of growth I’ve had—whether in research skills, policy analysis, or just confidence in my abilities—has been incredible. Before this, I had never done such extensive research or extracted valuable insights in such a structured way, but this experience pushed me to develop skills I never knew I had. The exposure, mentorship, and hands-on engagement with policymakers made it clear that, even as a student, I can make an impact.",
