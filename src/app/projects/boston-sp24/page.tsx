        The Boston team divided up the project scope based on research, data, and stakeholder engagement. By
        conducting a literature review on the technology procurement landscape, outlining standards for data
        interoperability and data integration, and conducting 1:1 interviews with City employees about the city-
        specific procurement process, the students were able to expand upon the limitations of procurement
        standards and scope out a framework for ensuring equity and accessibility in procured technology.

        For the final deliverable, the students developed an internal 20-page technology procurement guideline for
        the City of Boston employees, establishing guiding values for the City of Boston&apos;s technology procurement
        process. They have structured these guidelines to develop actionable pathways for refining the technology
        procurement process and have incorporated legal requirements and case studies for practical application.
        The ultimate goal is for City staff and contractors to use this framework to evaluate procurement
        decisions, ensuring that technologies meet legal, technical, ethical, and community standards. Through
        thorough analysis of procurement research and stakeholder interviews, they identified three core pillars to
        guide ethical and effective technology procurement. They are as follows:

        <Text>
        • Community Focus: Adhering to the needs of the community served by the City of Boston should
        influence the technologies implemented by the city.
        </Text>
        <Text>
        • Technological Infrastructure: This pillar outlines guidelines for regulation, safe implementation, and
        architectural standards that technology goods and services should adhere to during development and
        maintenance.
        </Text>
        <Text>
        • Communication and Cooperation: This pillar outlines the shared responsibilities for collaboration
        between the City of Boston and contractors in order to build and maintain technological systems
        effectively.

        With technology procurement being a critical part of DoIt&apos;s government processes, this deliverable will
        guide City employees in providing clarity to the technology procurement process and establishing new
        standards for the role of procurement in their respective departments. By doing so, this can contribute to
        a more formal procurement management function and simplify the traditional procurement experience to
        be more efficient and frictionless.
