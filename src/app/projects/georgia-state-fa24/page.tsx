        <Text>
        Generative AI is revolutionizing public service operations, and The State of Georgia remains committed to advancing the responsible use of emerging technologies as part of its broader strategy to promote efficiency, transparency, and public trust. In alignment with this mission, the Georgia Technology Authority (GTA) guides the development, implementation, and oversight of AI policies that shape the work of over 40,000 state employees. Building on last year&apos;s foundational policies, &quot;SS-23-002: AI Responsible Use (Standard)&quot; and &quot;PS-23-001: Enterprise Responsible Use (Policy),&quot; the Paragon Fellows have contributed extensively to updating and refining these AI standards to address emerging challenges in AI governance.
<br></br><br></br>
During the Fall 2024 term, the Paragon Policy Fellows supported GTA by conducting in-depth research and collaborative policy development. This work focused on identifying and addressing gaps in the existing guidelines, ensuring AI policies are adaptable and robust enough to accommodate rapid technological advancements. Our approach emphasized creating clear, actionable standards that can be implemented effectively across departments.
<br></br><br></br>
Through the efforts of the Fall 2024 Paragon Policy Fellows, the State of Georgia now possesses an updated framework that reflects the rapid evolution of Generative AI technologies. This framework emphasizes clarity, ethical practices, and a commitment to supporting state employees in navigating the complexities of AI in their roles.
