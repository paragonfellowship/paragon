          Through iterative literature reviews, case study analyses of existing regulations at various governmental
          levels, and regular consultations with city officials, AI policy experts, and technologists, the 
          team developed comprehensive policy guidelines and procedural recommendations. The students utilized a variety of 
          resources to develop a framework to maintain integrity of public input processes in the face of proliferating AI.

          The project culminated in presentations to the San José City Council Information Technology department
            and the Paragon Policy Spring 2024 community, along with a detailed Policy Guidelines Manual. Key
            proposed solutions include implementing new requirements and technologies for eComment user
            verification and email submission verification, as well as conducting brief and effective annual generative
            AI skills training for city staff managing public comment submissions. This initiative aims to enhance the
            integrity of public input processes in the face of evolving AI technologies.
