  <Text className="text-base md:text-lg">The Paragon Policy Mentorship Program is a six-month initiative designed to support current and former Paragon Fellows by pairing them with experienced professionals in the science, technology, and policy space. Mentors and mentees are matched based on shared interests, career goals, and availability. Once paired, mentees initiate the relationship and work with their mentor to set expectations, define goals, and schedule check-ins.<br /><br />The time commitment is intentionally light—just one hour per month—yet structured to create substantive conversations about career development, skills building, and navigating the tech policy landscape. In addition to one-on-one mentorship, participants benefit from being part of a broader professional community dedicated to building a more inclusive and capable public interest technology workforce.<br /> <br />Mentors are paired with mentees based on shared interests, career aspirations, and availability. Once matched, mentees will initiate introductions, and both parties will work together to define goals, meeting schedules, and discussion topics.</Text>
